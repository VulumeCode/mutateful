# `mutate4l`

**tl;dr:** `mutate4l` enables live coding in Ableton Live's session view. Set up transformations that trigger whenever a source clip is changed, including arpeggiation, shuffling, and ratcheting/retriggering.

## Concept
`mutate4l` reimagines Ableton Live's session view as a spreadsheet-like live coding setup. You add formulas to dynamically shuffle, arpeggiate, constrain scale, retrigger, and otherwise transform clips in myriad ways. Formulas operate on other clips (and in some cases input specified textually) to produce new clips. Unlike most experimental sequencers, `mutate4l` leverages Live's built-in sequencing functionality, allowing you to use and existing midi-based clip as a source of fresh inspiration.

Formulas are composed of one or more commands operating on one or more clips. Most commands have various options that can be set depending on your specific needs. They range from simple things like filtering out all notes with a length shorter than a given interval, to more esoteric things like arpeggiating one clip based on another, or creating glitchy beats by adding ratcheting/retrigging to specific notes.

## Examples

### Interleaving clips together
This example shows the simplest possible use of the interleave command, which can interleave two or more clips in various ways.

#### Command: `=b1 c1 interleave -mode event`
##### Can be shortened to `=b1 c1 ilev`

## Quick introduction

The easiest way to understand what `mutate4l` does is by comparing it to a traditional spreadsheet. Let's say you have two numbers that you'd like to multiply. You put one number in cell `A1`, another in `A2`, and in `A3` you enter the following (very simple) formula: `=A1 * A2`. Cell `A3` will then contain the result of this operation, and will update automatically whenever `A1` or `A2` changes. 

`mutate4l` works the same way, only with more musically interesting commands. For instance, you could shuffle the contents of clip `A1` using the contents of another clip, e.g. `A2`. The pitch values of the various notes in clip `A2` would then be used to shuffle the order of notes in `A1`. Similar to the example above, we would like the result to be inserted into clip `A3`, but instead of using a spreadsheet command we will use the following `mutate4l` formula: `=A1 shuffle -by A2`. In this example, `A1` is a *source clip* (i.e. the clip that will be transformed), and `A2` is the *control clip* (i.e. the clip that controls the transformation). The latter could be omitted, in which case clip `A1` would be shuffled using itself as the control clip. The formula for this would simply be `=A1 shuffle`. In the more technical documentation below, clip locations like `A1`, `A2` and so on are referred to as a `ClipReference`.

More usage examples will follow. In the meantime, star this repo and/or follow me at [twitter.com/KnUpland](https://twitter.com/KnUpland) for updates.

## Available commands [Incomplete]

Basic syntax: [ClipReference #1](#parameter-types) ... [ClipReference #N](#parameter-types) commandname -parameter1 value -parameter2 value

Command | Parameters (default values in **bold**) | Description
--- | --- | ---
arpeggiate | -by <[ClipReference](#parameter-types)> -removeoffset -rescale <[Number](#parameter-types) in range 1-10> | Arpeggiates the given clip by another clip (could also be itself)
concat | | Concatenates the given clips into one clip.
constrain | -by <[ClipReference](#parameter-types)> -mode **pitch**&#124;rhythm&#124;both -strength <[Number](#parameter-types) in range 1-**100**> |
filter | -duration <[MusicalDivision](#parameter-types): **1/64**> -invert | Filters out notes shorter than the length specified (default 1/64). Works the other way round if -invert is specified. 
interleave | -chunkchords -mode event&#124;time -ranges <list of [MusicalDivision](#parameter-types)> -repeats <list of [Number](#parameter-types)> -skip -solo |
monophonize | | Removes any overlapping notes. Often useful on control clips, which often work best when there are no overlapping events.
ratchet | <ratchet values e.g. 1 2 3 4> -autoscale -by [ClipReference](#parameter-types) -mode velocity&#124;pitch -shape **linear**&#124;easeinout&#124;easein&#124;easeout -strength <[Decimal](#parameter-types) in range 0.0-**1.0**> -velocitytostrength |
relength | -factor <[Decimal](#parameter-types) in range 0.0-**1.0**> |
resize | -factor <[Decimal](#parameter-types) in range 0.0-**1.0**> |
shuffle | <shuffle indexes e.g. 1 2 3 4> -by [ClipReference](#parameter-types) |
slice | list of [MusicalDivision](#parameter-types) |
transpose | <transpose values, e.g. 0 -12 12> -by [ClipReference](#parameter-types) -mode absolute&#124;relative&#124;overwrite |

## Parameter types

Type | Description
--- | ---
ClipReference | Cells in the session view are referenced like they would be in a spreadsheet, i.e. tracks are assigned letters (A-Z) and clip rows are assigned numbers (1-N). Example: track 1 clip 1 becomes A1, track 2 clip 3 becomes B3.
MusicalDivision | These are commonly used in sequencer software to denote musical divisions like quarter notes, eight notes and so on. Examples: quarter note = 1/4, eight note = 1/8.
Number | Whole number (integer), either negative or positive
Decimal | Decimal number, from 0.0 and upwards
